# Mini Maker Mill

## Objective
Design and develop a hybrid manufacturing system capable of CNC milling and 3D printing using a dual-head machine on a single axis.

## Outcomes & Contributions
- Designed the dual-head assembly in SolidWorks integrating a CNC spindle and a 3D printer hotend
- Contributed to machine frame and axis layout
- Conducted SolidWorks FEA to validate 3D printed parts
- Supported subsystem integration and testing

## Technical Details & Skills
- SolidWorks CAD and assemblies
- Structural frame design and motion system layout
- G-code processing and Arduino integration
- Multi-functional machine development

## Results
Demonstrated rotational switching between heads and basic motion control while meeting footprint and strength constraints.
