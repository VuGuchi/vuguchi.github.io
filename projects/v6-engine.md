# 3D Modeled V6 Engine

## Objective
To acquire working knowledge of a V6 engine by researching the functional roles and typical materials used for each major component

## Outcomes & Contributions
- Developed a general understanding of how each engine part contributes to internal combustion and mechanical motion
- Conducted independent research on common industry materials for over 15 components
- Compiled a clear, organized report linking each component to its function and typical material
- Participated in VR and environmental effect integration to enhance user immersion
- Improved skills in technical documentation and engineering research

## Technical Details & Skills
- Built a full 3D model of a V6 engine in SolidWorks based on a tutorial without detailed specifications of engine type or geometry
- Researched the function, purpose, and commonly used materials for major parts such as pistons, crankshaft, valves, and exhaust manifold
- Focused on the proper use of material for its intended function and gained an in depth understanding of the functionality of an engine

## Results
Created a simple reference guide with their commonly used materials. For instance, forged aluminum is often used for pistons due to its lightweight properties, and cast iron is frequently used for exhaust manifolds for its durability. This project provided foundational knowledge of component function
