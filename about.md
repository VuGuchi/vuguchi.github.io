# About Me

I’m a recent Mechanical Engineering graduate from Cal Poly Pomona with a passion for mechanical design, CAD modeling, and structural systems. I thrive in hands-on, project-based environments where I can bring ideas to life through solid engineering principles and creative problem-solving.

My academic journey has been shaped by multidisciplinary team projects, from reverse engineering to building hybrid manufacturing systems, strengthening my skills in SolidWorks, technical communication, and collaborative design.
